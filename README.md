# pshcalc

A Rust library that should eventually be useful for carrying out calculations with finite categories and finite presheaves on them. Currently some functionality for sets and categories is implemented, with as usecases scripts for counting the number of semigroups (+-20s) and the number of monoids (+-20ms) on 4 elements.
